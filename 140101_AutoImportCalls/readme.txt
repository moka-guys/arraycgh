Prerequisites & installation:
    python 2.7.5 (python-2.7.5.msi)
    pyodbc 3.0.7 (pyodbc-3.0.7.win32-py2.7.exe)
    pandas 12 (pandas-0.12.0.win32-py2.7.exe)
    numpty 1.8.0 (numpy-1.8.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe)
    dateutil 1.5 (copy the dateutil folder into the python directory)

    All packages are in F:\Moka\Files\Software\IntervalsToMoka\
    Install python into C:\Array\Software\python27
    Then install pyodbc, pandas and numpty
    Then copy the dateutil folder from
    F:\Moka\Files\Software\IntervalsToMoka\python-dateutil-1.5\dateutil\
    into the python27 directory

Script location:
    F:\Moka\Files\Analysis\IntervalsToMoka

Python version:
    This script was created using python 2.7.5

Usage:
    IntervalsToMoka RunNumber
    This will search for an input file called RunNumber + _IntervalBasedReport.xls
    in F:\Moka\Files\Analysis\Year\Run\
    This will output a file called RunNumber + _IFM.csv
    in F:\Moka\Files\Analysis\Year\Run\

Actual usage:    
    Moka-Analytics-Auto-import calls
    This will open a form that requests a run number
    Enter the run number and click import
    That calls this python script which then reformats the data in the interval-based report 
    generated by genomic workbench to something that is Moka-friendly, adds sampleID/hybID 
    information from Moka, and creates an output text file that Moka can use to import the calls
    Moka imports everything into a holding table with an import flag of 1
    It changes that flag to 5 for anything that doesn't match one of the predefined referral
    categories that we want to autoimport
    Everything that is still a 1 then gets imported into the calls table and the flag is updated 
    to 2 to show that this has happened
